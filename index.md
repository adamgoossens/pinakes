## What is Pinakes?

Pinakes is the upstream community project for RedHat's Automation Services Catalog product.

Pinakes allows customers to expose their Ansible Job Templates and Workflows to business users with an added layer of governance. The Job Templates and Workflows are wrapped as Products into Portfolios which can be shared with different business users. An approval workflow can be attached to Products or Portfolios which adds governance and, in the future, will be able to notify the appropriate Administrators via email. Upon approval, the Job Template or workflow will be launched on the Automation Controller.


## Key Features

With Pinakes, you can:
* Apply business governance to product execution, reducing mistakes and verifying correct usages
* Alter surveys to be more restrictive, allowing only specified values or making others read-only or hidden
* Only share portfolios and products with users who you deem should have access to them
